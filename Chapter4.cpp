    What does overflow mean? Show three expressions that will overflow.

    In C++, overflow occurs when a value is assigned to a variable that exceeds the maximum or minimum value that the variable can represent. The behavior of overflow is undefined, which means that the result of an operation that causes overflow is not guaranteed to be predictable or consistent across different systems or compilers.

    Here are three expressions that will overflow:

    int max = INT_MAX + 1;
    This expression tries to assign a value to max that is one greater than the maximum value that an int can represent. 
    This will result in overflow, and the value of max will be implementation-defined.

    short s = SHRT_MAX; s += 1;
    This expression tries to add 1 to the maximum value that a short can represent. 
    This will result in overflow, and the value of s will be implementation-defined.

    unsigned int x = 0; x -= 1;
    This expression tries to subtract 1 from an unsigned int with a value of 0. 
    This will result in underflow, which is a type of overflow that occurs when a value is assigned to a variable that is less than the minimum value that the variable can represent. 
    The behavior of underflow is also undefined in C++.

        cp is a pointer to a string literal "Hello World".
        cp is not null, so the first part of the condition (cp) is true.
        *cp dereferences the pointer cp and gives us the value of the first character of the string, which is 'H'.
        Since 'H' is not null, the second part of the condition (*cp) is also true.
        
    Therefore, the overall result of the condition is true, and the code inside the if statement will be executed.

    The purpose of this condition is to check if the pointer cp is pointing to a non-empty string. 
    If cp were null or if the string were empty (i.e., the first character were null), the condition would evaluate to false, and the code inside the if statement would not be executed.

    The expression i != j < k is a chained comparison expression that uses the less than operator < and the not equal to operator !=. However, the order of evaluation is not immediately clear due to the operator precedence rules.

    According to the precedence rules, the less than operator < has higher precedence than the not equal to operator !=. Therefore, the expression is equivalent to i != (j < k).

    Here's how the expression is evaluated step by step:

    j < k: This sub-expression compares the values of j and k using the less than operator <. 
    If j is less than k, this sub-expression evaluates to true (which has a value of 1). 
    Otherwise, it evaluates to false (which has a value of 0).
    
    i != (j < k): This sub-expression compares the value of i with the value of the sub-expression j < k. 
    If i is not equal to the value of j < k, this sub-expression evaluates to true (which has a value of 1). 
    Otherwise, it evaluates to false (which has a value of 0).
    
    In summary, the expression i != j < k checks if j is less than k, and if i is not equal to the result of that comparison.

    Given that ptr points to an int, that vec is a vector<int>, and that ival is an int, explain the behavior of each of these expressions. 
    Which, if any, are likely to be incorrect? 
    Why? How might each be corrected?

    (a) ptr != 0 && *ptr++: 
    This expression first checks if ptr is not null, and then evaluates the value pointed to by ptr and increments ptr. 
    The behavior of this expression depends on the initial value of ptr. 
    If ptr is null, the expression will short-circuit and not evaluate the second operand. 
    Otherwise, the expression will evaluate to the value pointed to by the original value of ptr and then increment ptr. 
    This expression may be correct, depending on the intended behavior, but it can be confusing and hard to read. 
    To make it clearer, we could separate it into two statements:

    if (ptr != 0) {
        int val = *ptr;
        ++ptr;
        // use val as needed
    }

    (b) ival++ && ival: 
    This expression increments ival and checks if the original value of ival is non-zero. 
    If the original value of ival is zero, the expression will short-circuit and not evaluate the second operand. 
    Otherwise, the expression will evaluate to the new value of ival. 
    This expression is likely incorrect, because it increments ival twice: once in the first operand and once in the second operand. 
    To fix this, we could use two separate statements:

    ++ival; // increment ival
    if (ival) {
        // use ival as needed
    }

    (c) vec[ival++] <= vec[ival]: 
    This expression accesses two elements of the vector vec: one at index ival and another at index ival+1, and then increments ival. 
    The behavior of this expression depends on the values of the elements accessed. 
    If vec[ival] <= vec[ival+1], the expression will evaluate to true. 
    Otherwise, the expression will evaluate to false. 
    This expression is likely incorrect, because it modifies ival twice: once in the index expression for the left-hand side of the comparison and once in the index expression for the right-hand side of the comparison. 
    To fix this, we could use two separate statements:

    int lhs = vec[ival++];
    int rhs = vec[ival];
    if (lhs <= rhs) {
        // use lhs and rhs as needed

    string pl = s + (s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s");

    This evaluates the condition s[s.size() - 1] == 's', and appends an empty string "" if the condition is true, or the string "s" otherwise, to the end of the original string s.

    In Latin-1 character set, the bit pattern for 'q' is 01110001. Applying the bitwise complement operator ~ on this value gives its complement, which is 10001110.

    In a machine with 32-bit ints and 8-bit chars, the expression ~'q' first promotes the character 'q' to an integer by sign-extending the value to 32 bits. Since 'q' has a bit pattern of 01110001, its sign bit is 0 and sign-extending it gives 00000000 00000000 00000000 01110001. Applying the bitwise complement operator on this value results in 11111111 11111111 11111111 10001110.
